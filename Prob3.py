    # By default this will create a random number between 0 and 100 for you to try to
    # guess. While you are testing, a random number might not be very useful. So I've
    # have hardcoded in a point below where you can enter in your own number. But
    # MAKE SURE TO COMMENT OUT THE BELOW LINE WHEN YOU ARE TESTING AND SUBMITTING THE FINAL VERSION
    unknown = 47

    # Add your code below to setup the main game loop and logic checks
    # Remember that you want to prompt the player for a number and then tell
    # them if the unknown is higher or lower each round. And you want to keep
    # playing rounds until they guess the number. Make sure you keep track of
    # the number of rounds played so you can give them a score at the end!

    # Game Code





    # Printing out final score (number of guesses) at end







# You don't need to change anything below this.
