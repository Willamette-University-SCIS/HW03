## Instructions
The homework pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the `Prob1.py` file already in the repository
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. 
 	- Make sure you meet all your requirements!

#### Testing
Automated tests for Problems 1 and 2 will attempt to make sure everything is working properly. For Problem 3 things are very open ended, so the tests will just look to try to see that you used a loop somewhere, defined a function somewhere, and used a `GLabel`. I'll check the rest myself.
