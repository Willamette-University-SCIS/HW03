# Homework 02
![](https://github.com/<user_info>/workflows/Autotesting/badge.svg)

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of February 7th at midnight!

## Instructions
The homework pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Your written work should be in the form of a pdf, and the pdf should be titled `HW2.pdf`. Use an app like Scannable or Genius Scan to convert your images to black and white to hugely cut down on the size of the created pdf. (I don't need 20+ megapixel images of your homework!)
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 4 should be done in the `Prob4.py` file already in the repository. 

A reminder that tutors are available Monday and Thursday nights!

#### Testing
Automated tests for Problem 2 will check that you are outputting the correct content for both types of possible words. Testing for problem 3 will just be checking if you are outputting the correct "higher/lower" options and the proper score at the end. All I'm checking (and can check) in Problem 4 is if you used a `while` loop somewhere. The rest I'll have to inspect in person.
