# Homework 02

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of Sep 12 at midnight (A THURSDAY this time!)

## Instructions
The homework pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Your written work should be in the form of a pdf, and the pdf should be titled `HW2.pdf`. Use an app like Scannable or Genius Scan to convert your images to black and white to hugely cut down on the size of the created pdf. (I don't need 20+ megapixel images of your homework!)
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. I'd highly suggest downloading the repository and editing the file directly in a text editor rather than writing the code on your own and then trying to paste it back in. Formatting errors frequently arise when doing copy and paste operations!
 - [ ] Code for Problem 4 should be done in the `Prob4.py` file already in the repository. Again, I'd recommend downloading the repository and editing the file directly in your text editor.

I have moved the due date for this homework to Thursday to better take advantage of the tutoring happening on Tuesday and Thursday nights. This does mean I probably won't get graded materials back to you until the weekend most weeks.

#### Testing
Automated tests will be present for Problem 4 and to check for the presence of your pdf. I will probably not be writing any for Problem 3 due to its more freeform nature. Testing that will be up to you!
